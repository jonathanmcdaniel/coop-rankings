# coop-rankings
Node.js tool for reading a csv file created from a google forms survey to automate selection of intern candidates for hiring. When an interview is complete a form is filled out by the interviewers. This information would be used to select the best fit candidate for each open position and make suggestions to the intern coordinator for who to hire.

## Current Status
Currently the project only reads in the CSV file and converts to JSON for easier processing.

## Vision
Interviewers will input feedback into the google form, CSV file will be downloaded at the end of the interview round and this tool will analyze all available candidates. Through identifying ranking information as well as keywords and other possible factors such as if they have worked at the organization before. Candidate suggestions would then be provided as well as qualified alternates for each position as the output.
